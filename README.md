# VaccinationLearning
Although vaccination is crucial in the fight against
infectious diseases, vaccine uptake rates still vary widely among
populations. Identifying individuals at higher risk of not getting
vaccinated can help in targeted intervention strategies to improve
vaccination rates. This paper outlines the machine learning
methodologies used for the Flu Shot Learning competition on
DrivenData, which involved predicting the likelihood of individuals
receiving vaccination against H1N1 and seasonal flu-based
on demographic, socio-economic, and behavioural features. We
performed data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, and
tuning steps to develop an optimised prediction model using
CatBoostClassifier, a gradient boosting algorithm. Our findings
showed that the best-proposed model achieves a promising ROC
AUC score of 83.8 on the competition test data provided by
DrivenData, indicating its potential for accurate flu vaccine
uptake prediction. Our study provides valuable insights into the
use of machine learning models to predict flu vaccine uptake,
which could aid in the development of targeted intervention
strategies to improve vaccination rates in different populations.
